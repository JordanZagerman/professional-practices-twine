[[“I believe in the Big Boy&#39;s Big Values, and I want to be able to share that with our community.”]]

[[“For the money. I don’t want to be that one kid at my school without a job and cash- that’s lame.”]]

An intimidating woman greets you from behind the counter, 

“Welcome- oh, hey,  you look pretty nervous, kid. You must be the fresh meat I gotta interview today. Go ahead and pop a squat at one of the tables and I’ll be there in a sec’.”

You sit down at one of the dining room tables and look around the room as you wait. After a minute goes by you see the employee walk towards you. Your eyes land on her pants’ open fly, and your blood runs cold. What do you do?

Jen: “Hey, dude! It’s been a while….”

*Jen talks with the customer for a minute as she takes his order. She grabs the food from the kitchen window and she shoves it in a bag.

Jen: “Hey, grab a medium coke for me, will ya’?”

[[*You notice there are only Pepsi products available from the soda machine. You fill a cup with Pepsi and hand it to Jen.]]

The time comes for the customer to pay, but you’re not sure how to process the transition. There seems to be three buttons you can choose from.

Jen: “What did you do??? Oh shit- the emergency button! I gotta call ‘em...”

*Jen reaches for the store phone that rests on the counter. After talking for a minute, she hangs up and she turns back to you.

Jen: “You’re not making a good first impression, kid. Don’t go randomly pressing buttons!”

You pat yourself on the back for a second before you get an idea- what if you were to press one of the other buttons? What could possibly go wrong?
